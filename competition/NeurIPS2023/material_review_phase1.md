#### 2. Code (.zip file):

Your code should be capable of reproducing the score on the current leaderboard (with a permissible deviation of up to  5%). 

To facilitate code execution, **we strongly recommend that you provide necessary dependent third-party package information and place the main procedures code into a file  named 'main.py.'** This will allow us to run your solution using the 'python main.py' command. 

Please note that, at this stage, we will conduct a basic check of the code you submit.  **Blank or non-functional code will be considered invalid and may affect your qualification for Phase 2.**
